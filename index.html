			<p> 
				Hi! I’m Nicole, Co-founder of HospoNow, a job board website that specializes in hospitality. 
				I am originally from Wellington and moved up to Napier in March 2020 to study a diploma in IT at EIT. 
				I have had a range of jobs in several industries, some of these jobs included; head barista at Mojo, Account Coordinator at Carsales.com.au, 
				where I worked with car manufacturers such as BMW & Audi managing their digital advertising campaigns and Salesforce Administrator at NZX where 
				I was responsible for creating/ maintaining the platform, training of users and documentation.
			</p>

				Hello! I’m Nadine, Co-Founder of HospoNow. I was originally born in Germany and now live in Central Napier where I am currently studying a Diploma 
				in Information Systems at EIT. Prior to this I was working full time in Wellington as a Customer Service Technician for a company that sells 
				reservation software to hospitality businesses. 
				My strengths lie in customer service, with a large majority of my work experience being in this sector as this is 
				something I enjoy and continue to utilise in my current job as 2IC of Napier Cotton On.
